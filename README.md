Each player starts with 0 points.

On his turn, the player rolls 2 dice (standard six-sided dice).

The number of spots thrown is added to the total number of points.

Starting from the second round:

if a player rolls a 7, he divides his number of points by that value, discarding the fraction

if he rolls an 11, he multiplies the current number of points by that value.

The first player to score 2001 points wins.
